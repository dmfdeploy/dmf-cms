⚠️ NEVER paste secrets, credentials, real IPs/DNS, kubeconfigs, Terraform state,

responsibility first.

## What & why

<!-- One paragraph: what this changes and the motivation. -->

Refs dmfdeploy/dmfdeploy#NNN

<!-- Replace NNN with the issue number. Keep the full dmfdeploy/dmfdeploy prefix: CI rejects a bare #NNN. For a change with no issue, ask a maintainer for the `no-issue` label. -->
